  "title": "Designing Digital Experiences for Participants in a National Health Research Program",
  "client": "NIH",
  "problem": "Medical research has a diversity problem. 90% of the U.S. patient population aren't involved in research and don't want to think about their health — until they have to (Ma et al., Minority Representation in Clinical Trials in the United States, 2021). The *All of Us Research Program* aims to enroll one million participants to deliver the most diverse medical research database. To reach and maintain that number of participants, the program requires design focused on the participant experience. Our team at GoInvo, with experience and expertise in health design for humans and shipping research software, brought this focus to the foreground and tackled a variety of challenges:\n\n How do we... \n - Deliver health surveys and health information to participants from all walks of life, in a way all can understand?\n - Craft meaningful returns of value to the participants, to show appreciations and recognition for their contribution?\n - Onboard new participants and help them  understand participation, consent, and data privacy?\n - Show the value of participation to the nation and to the lives of all patients?",
  "solution": "GoInvo led product design as part of the Participants Technology Systems Center (PTSC) for the *All of Us* participant portal on behalf of Vibrent Health from 2020 through 2024. GoInvo designers became participants, spoke to participants, and dived deep into the program. We worked across the consortium of stakeholders including all roles from policy experts to researchers to design and launch program initiatives and strategies that meet participants where they are. We collaboratively developed participant journeys, screen content, and UI designs, then worked with the technical teams to see those designs all the way to delivery.",
  "results": "Through program-wide design, UX leadership, guidance, and coordination between research groups, program offices, and technology delivery teams, our team has helped to:\n\n -  Deliver experiences for participants to contribute more health information through surveys and sharing biosamples.\n - Provide engaging insights to share with participants what the program is learning from their contributions.\n - Make accessible pathways to encourage more participants to join the *All of Us* Research Program. \n - Reach 700,000+ enrolled participants and growing.",

      "text": "The *All of Us Research Program*, run by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is a nationwide health study that aims to collect health data from a diverse group of 1 million or more people living in the United States. The program aims to run for 10 years or more, providing this diverse dataset longitudinally. Every human is unique, with different genes, lifestyles, and living conditions, and circumstances that change over time. The more researchers can learn about what affects people's health, the better they will be able to drive research that impacts more humans. \n\n The program is an ambitious government-funded health research effort with the goal to retain and engage participants long-term. More than a hundred funded partner organizations work together to run the *All of Us Research Program*. GoInvo was brought in as a small task force, working as the design team for the PTSC under Vibrent Health to support the digital experience in the PTSC Participant Portal."

We enrolled, becoming official participants in the *All of Us Research Program* and learned first hand what the participant experience is, with an understanding that there are variations across participants.  \n\n  **Get to know the platform (behind the scenes).** \n Based on our expert review we proposed improvements. The recommendations ranged from user interface enhancements such as styling, consistency of interactions, to content voice, readability, comprehension, information hierarchy and architecture. In the process, we learned that operational, engineering, and policy constraints impose major roadblocks to all sorts of changes, including simple details like button color. The reality of designing for a national research program is that prioritization and scope of work depend upon funding, and we learned how to design and strategize within those constraints. \n\n **Repeat for every initiative.** \n Every new initiative has its own intricacies. Read the protocol, live the related experiences, and check with engineering to get ahead of any expected limitations and considerations. Build an understanding of what you're working with right up front."

      "text": "**Balanced usability, technical, and program needs.** \n\n Launching a new activity, like a survey, to the participant portal can take several months and up to a year or more. GoInvo worked closely with the NIH program and UX strategy teams to understand the initiative goals — what we are asking participants to do, and what participants need in return. We then worked together with all stakeholders, including researchers, policy experts, product owners, NIH UX strategists, designers, and engineers, to fine tune the requirements and designed flows, content, and screens. We considered not only the best user experience but also data collection completeness, accessibility to participants who are underrepresented in biomedical research (UBR), implementation timeline and resources, and transparency. \n\n  Every experience must be approved by the program’s institutional review board (IRB) and NIH leadership members. Once the protocol was approved, implementation began. When ready, we reviewed the experience in a testing environment and reported bugs to be addressed before launching to public participants. Throughout the process, our role as user experience designers was to advocate for participants and support the best experience while balancing usability against program policy and implementation constraints. \n\n **Developed strategy for returning personal and program results.** \n\n The program aims to provide meaningful value to participants by returning results based on their provided biosamples and completed surveys. Through interviews and feedback, we found that participants needed more context and substance than the program was providing. This called for creative solutions to deliver meaning and context within policy and technical limitations. We developed and validated with participants content guidelines, templates, and a process to help teams deliver results that participants will find valuable. Participants also told us they wanted to hear about program success. So we designed and saw through the launch a new 'Insights' page delivering news and announcements about scientific discoveries across the consortium."

      "text": "### The future of medical research engages participants \n\n If medical research programs aim to prioritize participant enrollment and retention, a digital experience for participants should:\n\n - Provide participants with more transparency and agency around the data they provide for research. \n -  Acknowledge participant contribution with choice-focused return of value framework to encourage participation and involvement in the program community. \n -  Provide participants with more connections to research using program data. \n -   Personalize the participant journey and research returns based on the data they provide. \n -  Support participant decision-making for difficult topics while reducing condescension or coercion in messaging. \n -  Prioritize optimal data collection for ease of use, readability, and comprehension, which will also support providing quality, clean data for researchers to use. \n\n ### National research projects pose unique challenges \n\n **Participants come from diverse backgrounds and have different needs.** Understanding participants is critical to designing for a flexible program that addresses varied circumstances and meets participants where they are. \n\n **Different teams have different backgrounds, priorities, and responsibilities.** Program goals, technical constraints, policy requirements, and participant needs are not always aligned. As designers, we must lean on design approaches and champion their impact on the user experience. We needed to drive conversations by showing designs to support informed decision-making with the program that highlight what is best for the participant. And sometimes, we must be ready to swiftly develop alternative solutions across barriers.\n\n **Program decisions are sometimes made prematurely, without fully considering implementation and user experience consequences.** We learned to push our way into projects earlier and get involved with the smaller decision-making teams. We advocated for the participant user experience and crafted flexible solutions that accommodate less-than-ideal situations.\n\n **Different teams and situations call for different methods of design and communication.** Visual designs couldn't support all conversations. It's important to identify the right kind of delivery and level of detail, whether documentation, specs, requirements, or a bullet list.\n\n"
