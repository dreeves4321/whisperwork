  "problem": "The major issues and statistics for US healthcare are tough to understand and see, even in a data and analysis-rich command center, let alone on your phone. The MITRE Health Lab needed a large-scale, national healthcare storytelling service, to show public health officials, researchers, and policy makers the ground truth.",
  "solution": "An interactive healthcare story engine that help researchers and scientists to showcase their work in context of national problem sets and information.",
  "results": "We designed and shipped an open source touch screen service to show public health information and stories.",
  "commitment": "Team of 3 designers and engineers for 12 weeks. I contributed to all stages of design, data architecture, and front-end development.",

Because the touchscreen software limited customizable experiences, we worked with the company that provided the interactive panels to design and engineer the new functions. Although their customer service for everyday problems was very good; the business model at the root of the software limitations is a detriment to innovation, self-curation, and evolving the software from outside their firewall. \n\n We worked around this closed “feature” by extending the built-in Chrome browser to expand contiguously across all 12 touchscreens. We then developed a custom experience using open web standards at a fraction of the cost, pain, and time."
