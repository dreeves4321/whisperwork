	    	"text": "**Prior authorization is a frequent reality for cancer patients and their families.** \n\n Health insurers use prior authorization to review and control the delivery and payments for treatments. They not only control cost and efficiency, but also ensure the patients are receiving high-quality and up-to-date standards of care. When a provider determines a line of treatment for their patient, their team submits a request to the patient's insurer. The treatment case is then reviewed for eligibility and coverage and a decision is made, whether approval, adjustment, or denial. \n\n **Burdensome for experts who provide prior authorization.** \n\nSome insurers outsource these reviews to services that specialize in processing requests. These companies employ clinical and pharmacy experts to carefully review cases. This process requires reviewing not only the request but also patient and clinical records in great detail. However, the manual process requires sifting through piles of unstructured and redundant data, hunting down missing or incomplete materials, and communicating back and forth with administrative staff. Sometimes more complex or expensive cases require a second review. \n\n **Increased burden and delays mean anxiety, stress, and distrust for patients.** \n\n This process places a significant burden on providers, administrative staff, and the reviewers themselves. The requirements, administration, and review process can cause treatment delays of up to two weeks, increasing stress, anxiety, and distrust in the healthcare system for patients and their families. Delays and denials in care are particularly problematic for patients with cancer, who often need urgent treatment or symptom management and are left waiting while their condition worsens. \n\n **Our Task: reduce friction and increase analytical efficiency.** \n\n We worked with a company specializing in prior authorization for oncologiocal treatments to streamline their case review process. The improvements would make the reviewer's work more manageable, reduce overall costs, reduce treatment wait times, and reduce follow-up administrative tasks required on the provider's side. We designed a flexible, smarter interface that uses a natural hierarchy of information and AI to present the right information at the right time to the right person. The reviewer could focus more on the medicine and less on hunting down and recording data."

	    	"text": "**Research: Background knowledge of oncological treatments is essential** \n\n We needed to build our knowledge of cancer treatments to better understand what case reviewers look for in their reviews. We worked with clinical reviewers to learn about their process and pain points that helped us focus on where we could make the most impact. To better understand and design for real-life cases and scenarios, we conducted research into treatments for different cancers, therapy lines, and the patient journey. We work with real data so that solutions meet the real needs of the people impacted by this process. \n\n **Observe and interrogate: Detailed review and interviews with case reviewers** \n\n We reviewed the software in detail, giving us a starting point for the fundamental problem areas. We watched reviewers work at various steps of the prior authorization process and different types of cases to build a deep understanding of the process and pain points. We continued interviews throughout the design process to validate the concepts, ensuring that the solutions met the needs of reviewers and staff at each stage. \n\n **Identify the pain points** \n\n - **A complex process is further complicated by a dense UI.** Tabular and grid-like data weighed down the reviewer system with little information hierarchy, and it could be challenging to find a small detail among a sea of patient data points. Simple actions became complex, as reviewers did a lot of navigating back and forth, clicking, opening windows and pop-ups, and struggling to review information side by side. What should be simple processes take a lot of steps and clicks. The information structure and workflows needed reworking. \n - **Disparate documentation led to more detective work.** To fully understand and make an informed decision on the protocol requested by the provider, reviewers needed to understand the complete picture of the patient over time, the progression of their cancer, previous treatments, side effects they've experienced... the whole patient. Reviewers hunt for this information through many documents, verifying outdated information and taking notes to build a patient history for reference during their review. Then next time, in a few months, doing it all over again. The documents needed identification and classification, and clinical data needed better structure, persistence, and presentation for quick visual understanding of the patient. \n - **Notes needed better capture.** Throughout the process, reviewers and administrators take notes of key information. These notes are critical for documenting their decisions, crafting requests for more information from providers, or for sending the case to a colleague. However, they have no way to maintain these notes within the software without losing the context of the protocol and patient. Giving reviewers a convenient way to take notes at any point during their review was essential without disrupting their focus on the content. Reliable note saving was also essential, enabling reviewers to quickly return to their previous point if interrupted. \n - **The reviewer's queue is straightforward, but there was still room for improved efficiency.** In their system, the queues were hard to manipulate and scan and reviewers could not see colleagues queues, so they developed creative workarounds to be able to share. \n\n **Design a better way.** Having validated our understanding of the problems and workflows with the users, we began developing new concepts. We shared ideas, walked through concepts, got feedback, and iterated. We put prototypes in the hands of users and tested, and iterated more. As we developed concepts, we built out a style and component library to ensure consistency and provide development support down the road. Everything was done in collaboration with users, both administrative and clinical."

The most critical information is front and center to ensure the reviewer is referring to the correct patient and condition. Because of the sheer amount of information needed for a complete case, we paid attention to what information was truly needed in what contexts. For example, Provider contact information is included if the reviewer needs to ask questions or reach out to confirm or locate any missing information. Additionally, Admin information, which previously took up a lot of space, creating distance between the patient information and contextual information needed for a review is also accessible here. \n\n **Reviewing the Protocol / Treatment Request** \n\n Protocol information is similarly up front, with more detail in an expandable drawer for a detailed review of timing and dosing, which can collapse when no longer needed. We wanted to include multi-modality to access different features. In this context, if the reviewer notices a change is necessary, they may select to Change or Withdraw the protocol, Add protocol, or Modify dosing, and the drawer will collapse and allow them to make any changes necessary in the Actions panel, where they would submit their recommendations of adjustments, approval, or denial."

The data is discretely organized into categories as a functioning patient record to make it easier to locate the right information, and users have the option to explore the record as a timeline to get a chronological view of the patient history. This greatly reduces the time and effort spent on searching for information in many separate documents. \n\n Understanding that patient records aren't always complete and NLPs aren't perfect, missing information can be entered and saved as structured data. Users can also correct information that may be incorrect. Based on the patient's type of cancer, progression, and protocol request, we can also identify what information is required to make a safe determination on the prior authorization. Knowing that there could be cases when information may need to be updated for each round of a request for clinical safety, or information may drift or have conflicting entries, we identify which data points are in need of verification. Once verified, a reviewer can be sure that the information is correct for the following cases on this patient."

One challenge was to capture the concept of treatments over time, including active prescriptions and changes in therapy, which we indicate with the vertical strips on the side."

The automation would be able to save hundreds of hours of time, effort, and resources that otherwise would be spent by the prior authorization review team, payers, providers, and hospital systems –and patients would be able to start treatment much sooner than they would have in the past."
